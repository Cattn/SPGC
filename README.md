# SPGC
(Student Portal Grade Calculator)

- [Installation & Demo Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AHqCW1o0nqjZG6a7EEaQSCIAKIvxzLhF/view?usp=sharing)

## About this project
This project aims to allow students to manipulate their grades graphically within their student portal/information system. This allows for streamlined access to grade prediction and replacement, to allow students to better prioritize the work they need to complete. Currently, this project is limited to ``Palm Beach County School District``, however any other district using "SIS" for their portal, may be able to implement this extension.
