## About this project
This project aims to allow students to manipulate their grades graphically within their student portal/information system. This allows for streamlined access to grade prediction and replacement, to allow students to better prioritize the work they need to complete. Currently, this project is limited to ``Palm Beach County School District``, however any other district using "SIS" for their portal, may be able to implement this extension.
